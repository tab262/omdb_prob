Use threads - do the API calls in the background.
Data structure 
Two Queues
  1. Items to be pulled
  2. Items to be pulled and waiting to be inserted

Testing - can test scores to be geq to 0 and leq to 10


Easy - single thread. For each item, call API, append. Then sort and print.

Medium - multiple thEreads pulling from API and appending. Then sort on defined key. Then print. Add option to do bucket sort

Hard - Multithreaded pull, as well as multithread bucket sort. Locks for each array item.




ISSUES:
Characters like spaces are in movie titles -> need to replace with %20
Some movies will not be found...how to handle. Found case where movie title does not match year
Some titles have commas in them
Foreign language
